                <h4>Project description </h4>
                <p>This is a recycling of <a href="https://github.com/sherirosalia/Weather_Data_Analysis" class="badge badge-light" target="_blank">Weather Data Analysis</a> which was an assignment included in a Data Science certification program offered through UCSD. Revisiting the project provided an opportunity to compare api services from Google with the Python module hvPlot for maps and Geoapify API for geocoding. On the whole, all three are user friendly and as long as the developer stays below Google's usage threshold, are essentially free at a non enterprise level. Admittedly, Google's mapping capability is more robust but requires a credit card on file and it seems like the easy integration of hvPlot into Jupyter Notebook and lack of need to use an api will prove useful more often than not. Leaflet is also a part of this project to provide a bit more interactivity for the end user and and it seems to fill the gap nicely between what hvPlot and Google mapping services offer. The Geoapify API which also does not require a credit card to use for testing purposes seems reliable, offers many features beyond what was tested here, has extensive documentation and a playground to test the code.
                <p>
                    API pulls, analysis and hvPlot were done using Python. 
                    The interactive map built using D3.js and Leaflet. Code repository: <a href="https://github.com/sherirosalia/weather_analysis_redux" class="badge badge-light" target="_blank">Weather Analysis Redux</a>

                <h2>The data and it's limitations</h2>
                <p>The analysis reflects one day of weather information, and perhaps having access to information over longer periods of time would reveal findings of more significance. Additonally, there are simply less cities south of the equator, and the majority of the ones collected are in the western hemisphere, namely South America, so a longitudinal approach might be interesting to explore.</p>
